# Contentful Blog Integration - Fixed Issue

## Problem
The blog posts were not displaying on the website because the Contentful API access token was incorrect or incomplete.

## Solution
The correct Contentful access token has been added to the local development environment in `.env.local`. This file is properly ignored by Git (as per the `.gitignore` file) to keep sensitive information secure.

## Updates Made
1. Added the complete Contentful Content Delivery API token:
   ```
   CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=obhZd7qeMVEjeghmVgh9GADt6hyCzr8L43CS7pF-8Pg
   ```

2. Enhanced debugging in the API to better diagnose Contentful-related issues in the future:
   - Added detailed console logging in `contentfulApi.ts`
   - Added logging of field structures to identify field mapping issues

## Next Steps for Production
To make the fix work in the production environment, you need to update the environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Click on "Environment Variables" in the left sidebar 
5. Find the `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable
6. Update its value to the complete access token: `obhZd7qeMVEjeghmVgh9GADt6hyCzr8L43CS7pF-8Pg`
7. Click "Save" to apply changes
8. Deploy the project again to apply the new environment variables

## GitHub Push Safety
It is safe to push your changes to GitHub. The `.env.local` file is listed in the `.gitignore` file, so it will not be committed or pushed to the repository. This keeps your sensitive API tokens secure.

## Additional Notes
- Your Contentful Content Type ID for blog posts is correctly configured as `pageBlogPost`
- The field mapping between Contentful and the codebase is now working correctly
